/** @page tools_vsCode Legato Plugin for VSCode

The Legato team has been working hard on the next generation of an <b>Integrated Development
Environment (IDE)</b> to develop Legato Systems, Apps and Components.

We are proud to launch the Legato Plugin for Visual Studio Code.  The plugin provides simple to
use tools hooked up to a well known IDE that incorporates the Legato workflows and convenient tools
to let you develop and troubleshoot Legato.

The Legato Plugin for VS Code puts <b>tools into your hands to ease the learning curve and provide a
visual map</b> of how all the system pieces are put together for building the Legato runtime
environment.

We do value your feedback and want you to use the plugin. Report any issues in the
[VSCode category](https://forum.legato.io/) of the forum.

@section tools_vsCode_DevStudio Dev Studio?

What does this mean for Developer Studio?

Developer Studio is the previous IDE that was used to create and debug Legato systems. Developer
Studio has served us well for the last 10 years but we couldnâ€™t easily tie in the Developer Studio
workflow with the Legato workflow in a consistent way that was easy to maintain for current and
future features.

Support for Developer Studio has ended and the Legato plugin for VSCode is now the currently
supported IDE. Instructions for migrating your apps from Developer Studio to Visual Studio code are
provided here: @ref tools_vsCodeMigrate

Thank you for coming along on this journey with us to provide you an easy to use IDE that will help
you configure and code your Legato Systems quicker, getting your product to market quicker.
